<!--
The PR title must be written as if it is the subject line of a commit that contains the entire PR code. See https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules for how to write commit messages. If the PR fixes a single issue you can also use the issue title.

### Description

A brief summery of the changes. You do not need to repeat the description of the related issues. Instead consider explaining why you implemented something the way you did. For simple PRs it might be sufficient to just mention the issues it fixes.
-->

<!-- Mention all issues that the PR fixes like so: -->
Fixes #1
Fixes #2
Fixes parts of #3
